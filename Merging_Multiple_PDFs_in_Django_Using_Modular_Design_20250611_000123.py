Title: Merging Multiple PDFs in Django Using Modular Design

```python
# pdf_merge/views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render
from .utils import merge_pdfs
import os

def merge_pdf_view(request):
    """View to handle PDF merge requests."""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        pdf_files = request.FILES.getlist('pdf_files')
        merged_pdf_path = merge_pdfs(pdf_files)

        with open(merged_pdf_path, 'rb') as pdf_file:
            response = HttpResponse(pdf_file.read(), content_type='application/pdf')
            response['Content-Disposition'] = 'inline; filename="merged.pdf"'
        
        # Clean up the merged PDF file afterwards
        os.remove(merged_pdf_path)

        return response
    
    return render(request, 'pdf_merge/merge_pdfs.html')

# pdf_merge/utils.py
from PyPDF2 import PdfMerger
import os
from django.conf import settings

def merge_pdfs(pdf_files):
    """Merge multiple PDF files and return the file path of the resulting PDF."""
    merger = PdfMerger()
    for pdf in pdf_files:
        merger.append(pdf)

    output_file_path = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'merged.pdf')
    with open(output_file_path, 'wb') as merged_file:
        merger.write(merged_file)
    
    merger.close()
    return output_file_path

# pdf_merge/templates/pdf_merge/merge_pdfs.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Merge PDFs</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Merge PDFs</h1>
    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <input type="file" name="pdf_files" multiple required>
        <button type="submit">Merge</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>

# pdf_merge/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import merge_pdf_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('merge/', merge_pdf_view, name='merge_pdfs'),
]

# settings.py
# Ensure you have MEDIA_ROOT defined in your settings to handle file uploads and processing.
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

# Ensure PyPDF2 is installed
# pip install PyPDF2

```

In this modular Django feature:

- `views.py`: Handles the request to upload and merge PDF files.
- `utils.py`: Contains the utility function to perform the actual PDF merging using PyPDF2.
- HTML template (`merge_pdfs.html`): Provides a simple interface for uploading PDF files.
- Defined URL routing in `urls.py` for accessing the merge functionality.
- Make sure `MEDIA_ROOT` is defined in your `settings.py` to store temporary PDF files. 

This structure allows easy maintenance and separate concerns, adhering to clean and simple design principles.
