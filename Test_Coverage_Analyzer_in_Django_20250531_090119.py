# URL Configuration
# In your Django app's urls.py, wire up the view using:
# from .views import TestCoverageAnalyzer
# urlpatterns = [
#     path('coverage/', TestCoverageAnalyzer.as_view(), name='test_coverage'),
# ]
```

Note: This code assumes that the `coverage` and `pytest` tools are properly installed and configured. You'll also need to replace `'your_app'` with the name of the Django app you want to analyze. Run `coverage run --source=your_app -m pytest` command to create the initial coverage data before generating the JSON report with `coverage json`.
