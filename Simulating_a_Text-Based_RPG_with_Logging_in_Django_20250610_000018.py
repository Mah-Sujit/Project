Title: Simulating a Text-Based RPG with Logging in Django

```python
# Import necessary modules
import logging
from random import randint
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views import View

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Game classes to represent character and enemy
class Character:
    def __init__(self, name, health, power):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.power = power

    def attack(self, enemy):
        damage = randint(1, self.power)
        enemy.health -= damage
        logger.info(f"{self.name} attacks {enemy.name} for {damage} damage!")

class Enemy(Character):
    pass

# Main game simulation view
class RPGGameView(View):
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Initialize character and enemy
        hero = Character(name="Hero", health=100, power=20)
        monster = Enemy(name="Monster", health=80, power=15)

        # Log the start of the game
        logger.info("Game started between Hero and Monster")

        # Simulation loop
        while hero.health > 0 and monster.health > 0:
            # Hero attacks monster
            hero.attack(monster)
            if monster.health <= 0:
                logger.info(f"{monster.name} has been defeated!")
                return JsonResponse({"result": "Hero wins!"})

            # Monster attacks hero
            monster.attack(hero)
            if hero.health <= 0:
                logger.info(f"{hero.name} has been defeated!")
                return JsonResponse({"result": "Monster wins!"})

        return JsonResponse({"result": "Draw"})

# The URL routing in Django would connect to this view to run the simulation
```

This code establishes a basic text-based RPG simulation using Django alongside the logging module to document the sequence of events in the game. It includes defining simple `Character` and `Enemy` classes, which simulate attacks with random damage, and a single-game simulation loop through the `RPGGameView`. Each action is logged to provide a clear sequence of gameplay events.
